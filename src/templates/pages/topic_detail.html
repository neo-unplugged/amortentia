                    <p>Mechanics is further divided into two subfields: kinematics and dynamics. Kinematics focuses on
                        describing motion without considering its causes, using parameters like velocity, acceleration,
                        and
                        displacement. Dynamics examines the forces and energy responsible for motion.</p>
                    <p>One key equation in mechanics, derived from Newton's second law of motion, relates force, mass,
                        and
                        acceleration. This equation, \(F = ma\), describes how the motion of an object changes in
                        response
                        to an
                        applied force. It is fundamental in understanding the motion of all objects, from falling apples
                        to
                        the
                        movement of vehicles.</p>

                    <!-- <p>Understanding these basic equations allows us to predict the motion of objects in a wide variety of
                situations. For example, by knowing the mass of an object and the forces acting on it, we can calculate
                its acceleration and predict its future motion. This is crucial in engineering, where precise control of
                motion is required, such as in the design of cars, airplanes, and machinery.</p>
            <p>The study of mechanics also leads to a deeper understanding of energy and its conservation. In many
                physical processes, energy is neither created nor destroyed but transformed from one form to another.
                This principle is encapsulated in the law of conservation of energy, which plays a fundamental role in
                many areas of physics.</p> -->

                    <p><strong>[Explanatory (a)]</strong> The equation \(E = mc^2\) expresses the relationship between
                        energy
                        (\(E\)) and mass (\(m\)). This is a fundamental concept in Einstein's theory of relativity. It
                        shows
                        that mass can be converted into energy, and energy into mass. This principle is critical in
                        understanding nuclear reactions and particle physics.</p>
