    <!-- Top content -->
    <div class="content-top">
        <p>Mechanics is a branch of physics that deals with the study of motion, forces, and energy. It forms the
            foundation of classical physics and has applications in various fields, including engineering,
            astronomy, and everyday life.</p>
        <p>Newtonâ€™s laws of motion provide the framework for understanding mechanics. The first law, often referred
            to as the law of inertia, states that an object will remain at rest or in uniform motion unless acted
            upon by a net external force. This is a crucial concept that explains how objects respond to forces and
            the interaction between objects in motion.</p>
        <p>For example, a ball that is kicked will continue to roll until friction or another force acts on it. This
            fundamental concept is seen in everything from the motion of planets in space to the way we walk on
            Earth.</p>

    <!-- More content before the equation -->
    <div class="content-bottom">
        <p>Mechanics is further divided into two subfields: kinematics and dynamics. Kinematics focuses on
            describing motion without considering its causes, using parameters like velocity, acceleration, and
            displacement. Dynamics examines the forces and energy responsible for motion.</p>
        <p>One key equation in mechanics, derived from Newton's second law of motion, relates force, mass, and
            acceleration. This equation, \(F = ma\), describes how the motion of an object changes in response to an
            applied force. It is fundamental in understanding the motion of all objects, from falling apples to the
            movement of vehicles.</p>

        <p>\(\text{E} = mc^2\)</p>

        <p>\(\text{F} = ma\)</p>
    </div>
    <div class="equation">
        <p>\(\text{a} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}\)</p>
    </div>

    <!-- More content after the equation -->
    <div class="content-bottom">
        <p>Understanding these basic equations allows us to predict the motion of objects in a wide variety of
            situations. For example, by knowing the mass of an object and the forces acting on it, we can calculate
            its acceleration and predict its future motion. This is crucial in engineering, where precise control of
            motion is required, such as in the design of cars, airplanes, and machinery.</p>
        <p>The study of mechanics also leads to a deeper understanding of energy and its conservation. In many
            physical processes, energy is neither created nor destroyed but transformed from one form to another.
            This principle is encapsulated in the law of conservation of energy, which plays a fundamental role in
            many areas of physics.</p>

        <p><strong>[Explanatory (a)]</strong> The equation \(E = mc^2\) expresses the relationship between energy
            (\(E\)) and mass (\(m\)). This is a fundamental concept in Einstein's theory of relativity. It shows
            that mass can be converted into energy, and energy into mass. This principle is critical in
            understanding nuclear reactions and particle physics.</p>
